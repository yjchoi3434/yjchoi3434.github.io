<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">SOLUTION</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Because the graph of \(g'(x)\) is negative for all \(-2 \lt  x \lt  2\text{,}\) we know that the graph of \(g(x)\) must always be decreasing there.  The derivative appears to be zero at \(x = \pm 2\text{,}\) so the graph of \(g(x)\) must start out flat at \(x = -2\text{,}\) and then decreases more and more rapidly as it approaches \(x = -1\text{.}\)  After \(x = -1\) the it decreases less rapidly, finally flattening out entirely as we get to \(x = 2\text{.}\)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><em class="alert">A.</em> The graph has an inflection point at \(x = -1\text{,}\) where the slope changes from negative and decreasing to negative and increasing.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><em class="alert">B.</em> The function has a global maximum at \(x=-2\) and a global minimum at \(x=2\text{.}\)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><em class="alert">C.</em> Since the function is decreasing over the interval \(-2 \lt  x \lt  2\text{,}\) we know that \(g(0)\) must be less than \(g(-2)\text{,}\) and so must be in the interval \((-\infty,5)\text{.}\)  (We note that it appears that the magnitude of the derivative \(g'\) is also less than one for the entire domain that we are considering, so we can actually give a smaller interval for the possible values of \(g\text{;}\) any interval between \((-\infty,5)\) and \((3,5)\) is reasonable.)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><em class="alert">D.</em> Again, since the function is decreasing over the interval \(-2 \lt  x \lt  2\text{,}\) we know that \(g(-2) = 5 &gt; g(0) &gt; g(2)\text{.}\)</p>
