<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The Midpoint Rule is typically twice as accurate as the Trapezoid Rule, and the signs of the respective errors of these rules are opposites. Hence, by taking the weighted average \(S_{2n} = \frac{2M_n + T_n}{3}\text{,}\) we can build a much more accurate approximation to \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\) by using approximations we have already computed. The rule for \(S_{2n}\) is known as Simpson's Rule, which can also be developed by approximating a given continuous function with pieces of quadratic polynomials.</p>
