<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">When most people buy a large ticket item like car or a house, they have to take out a loan to make the purchase. The loan is paid back in monthly installments until the entire amount of the loan, plus interest, is paid. With a loan, we borrow money, say \(P\) dollars (called the principal), and pay off the loan at an interest rate of \(r\)%. To pay back the loan we make regular monthly payments, some of which goes to pay off the principal and some of which is charged as interest. In most cases, the interest is computed based on the amount of principal that remains at the beginning of the month. We assume a fixed rate loan, that is one in which we make a constant monthly payment \(M\) on our loan, beginning in the original month of the loan.</p>
