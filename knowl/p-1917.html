<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The sine and cosine functions are among the most important functions in all of mathematics. Sometimes called the <em class="emphasis">circular</em> functions due to their definition on the unit circle, these periodic functions play a key role in modeling repeating phenomena such as tidal elevations, the behavior of an oscillating mass attached to a spring, or the location of a point on a bicycle tire. Like polynomial and exponential functions, the sine and cosine functions are considered basic functions, ones that are often used in building more complicated functions. As such, we would like to know formulas for \(\frac{d}{dx} [\sin(x)]\) and \(\frac{d}{dx} [\cos(x)]\text{,}\) and the next two activities lead us to that end.</p>
