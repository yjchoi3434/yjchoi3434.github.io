<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">This text began as my sabbatical project in the winter semester of 2012, during which I wrote most of the material for the first four chapters. For the sabbatical leave, I am indebted to Grand Valley State University for its support of the project, as well as to my colleagues in the Department of Mathematics and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences for their endorsement of the project. I'm also grateful to the American Institute of Mathematics for their <a class="external" href="https://aimath.org/textbooks/" target="_blank">support of free and open textbooks in general</a>, and their support of this one in particular.</p>
