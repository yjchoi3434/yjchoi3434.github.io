<p>Both integration techniques we have discussed apply in relatively limited circumstances. It is not hard to find examples of functions for which neither technique produces an antiderivative; indeed, there are many, many functions that appear elementary but that do not have an elementary algebraic antiderivative. For instance, neither \(u\)-substitution nor integration by parts proves fruitful for the indefinite integrals</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\int e^{x^2} \, dx \ \ \text{and}  \ \ \int x \tan(x) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">While there are other integration techniques, some of which we will consider briefly, none of them enables us to find an algebraic antiderivative for \(e^{x^2}\) or \(x \tan(x)\text{.}\) We do know from the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus that we can construct an integral antiderivative for each function; \(F(x) = \int_0^x e^{t^2} \, dt\) is an antiderivative of \(f(x) = e^{x^2}\text{,}\) and \(G(x) = \int_0^{x} t \tan(t) \, dt\) is an antiderivative of \(g(x) = x \tan(x)\text{.}\) But finding an elementary algebraic formula that doesn't involve integrals for either \(F\) or \(G\) turns out not only to be impossible through \(u\)-substitution or integration by parts, but indeed impossible altogether. Antidifferentiation is much harder in general than differentiation.</p>
