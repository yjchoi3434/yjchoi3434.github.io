<p>To explain the meaning of these function and derivative values to someone who doesn't know calculus, we could say something like the following:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The given values of \(f(80) = 0.05\) and \(f'(80) = 0.0004\) tell us that when the car is going \(80\) kilometers per hour, it is using \(0.05\) liters of fuel for every kilometer it travels. In addition, for each additional kilometer per hour of velocity above \(80\) kph, we expect that the car will use about an additional \(0.0004\) liters of fuel per kilometer.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The values of \(g(80) = 20\) and \(g'(80) = -0.16\) tell us that when the car is going \(80\) kilometers per hour, it is able to travel \(20\) kilometers for each liter of fuel used. In addition, for each additional kilometer per hour of velocity above \(80\) kph, we expect that the car will be able to travel about \(0.16\) fewer kilometers per liter of fuel.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Finally, the values of \(h(80) = 4\) and \(h'(80) = 0.82\) tell us that when the car is going \(80\) kilometers per hour, it is using \(4\) liters of fuel for every hour it travels. In addition, for each additional kilometer per hour of velocity above \(80\) kph, we expect that the car will ues about \(0.082\) more liters of fuel per hour.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">Note that all three of these observations are saying fundamentally the same thing, just from different perspectives: the first regards fuel consumption measured in liters per kilometer; the second regards fuel consumption in kilometers per liter; and the last regards fuel consumption in liters per hour.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-2-3-prod-quot.html#vry">in-context</a></span>
