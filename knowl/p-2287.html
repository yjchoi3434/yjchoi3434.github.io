<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The idea demonstrated in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/PA-2-8.html" title="Preview Activity 2.8.1">Preview Activity 2.8.1</a> — that we can evaluate an indeterminate limit of the form \(\frac{0}{0}\) by replacing each of the numerator and denominator with their local linearizations at the point of interest — can be generalized in a way that enables us to evaluate a wide range of limits. We have a function \(h(x)\) that can be written as a quotient \(h(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\text{,}\) where \(f\) and \(g\) are both differentiable at \(x=a\) and for which \(f(a) = g(a) = 0\text{.}\) We would like to evaluate the indeterminate limit given by \(\lim_{x \to a} h(x)\text{.}\) <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F-2-8-LHR.html" title="Figure 2.8.1">Figure 2.8.1</a> illustrates the situation. We see that both \(f\) and \(g\) have an \(x\)-intercept at \(x = a\text{.}\) Their respective tangent line approximations \(L_f\) and \(L_g\) at \(x = a\) are also shown in the figure. We can take advantage of the fact that a function and its tangent line approximation become indistinguishable as \(x \to a\text{.}\)</p>
