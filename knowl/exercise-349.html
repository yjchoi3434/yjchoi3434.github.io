<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Continuous data is the basis for analog information, like music stored on old cassette tapes or vinyl records. A digital signal like on a CD or MP3 file is obtained by sampling an analog signal at some regular time interval and storing that information. For example, the sampling rate of a compact disk is 44,100 samples per second. So a digital recording is only an approximation of the actual analog information. Digital information can be manipulated in many useful ways that allow for, among other things, noisy signals to be cleaned up and large collections of information to be compressed and stored in much smaller space. While we won't investigate these techniques in this chapter, this exercise is intended to give an idea of the importance of discrete (digital) techniques.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Let \(f\) be the continuous function defined by \(f(x) = \sin(4x)\) on the interval \([0,10]\text{.}\) A graph of \(f\) is shown in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F-8-1-PA1.html" title="Figure 8.1.5">Figure 8.1.5</a>.</p>

<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Ineffective sampling can lead to several problems in reproducing the original signal. As an example, partition the interval \([0,10]\) into 8 equal length subintervals and create a list of points (the <em class="emphasis">sample</em>) using the endpoints of each subinterval. Plot your sample on graph of \(f\) in Figure <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F-8-1-PA1.html" title="Figure 8.1.5">Figure 8.1.5</a>. What can you say about the period of your sample as compared to the period of the original function?</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The sampling rate is the number of samples of a signal taken per second. As the part (a) illustrates, sampling at too small a rate can cause serious problems with reproducing the original signal (this problem of inefficient sampling leading to an inaccurate approximation is called <em class="emphasis">aliasing</em>). There is an elegant theorem called the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem that says that human perception is limited, which allows that replacement of a continuous signal with a digital one without any perceived loss of information. This theorem also provides the <em class="emphasis">lowest</em> rate at which a signal can be sampled (called the Nyquist rate) without such a loss of information. The theorem states that we should sample at double the maximum desired frequency so that every cycle of the original signal will be sampled at at least two points. Recall that the frequency of a sinusoidal function is the reciprocal of the period. Identify the frequency of the function \(f\) and determine the number of partitions of the interval \([0,10]\) that give us the Nyquist rate.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Humans cannot typically pick up signals above 20 kHz. Explain why, then, that information on a compact disk is sampled at 44,100 Hz.</p></li>
