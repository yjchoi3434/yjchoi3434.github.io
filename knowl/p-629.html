<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">For \(g(x) = x^2 - x + 3\text{,}\) we found that \(g'(x) = 2x - 1\text{.}\) For \(p(x) = 5x^2 - 4x + 12\text{,}\) we determined that \(p'(x) = 10x - 4\text{.}\) The constants \(3\) and \(12\) don't seem to affect the results at all, and that makes sense because those numbers only serve to shift the graphs of \(g\) and \(p\) vertically, which does nothing to change the slope. The coefficient \(-4\) on the linear term in \(p(x)\) appears to make the ``\(-4\)'' appear in \(p'(x)= 10x - 4\text{.}\) That, too, makes sense in light of the fact that if we considered only the linear function \(L(x) = -4x\text{,}\) the slope would everywhere be \(-4\text{,}\) in contrast to the coefficent \(-1\) found on the linear term in \(g(x) = x^2 - x + 3\text{,}\) which leads to the constant \(-1\) in \(g'(x) = 2x - 1\text{.}\) Finally, the leading coefficient \(5\) in \((x) = 5x^2 - 4x + 12\) leads to the coefficient of ``\(10\)'' in \(p'(x) = 10x -4\text{.}\) This makes sense because if we considered only \(y = 5x^2\text{,}\) the \(5\) would make the graph \(5\) times as steep as the graph of \(y = x^2\text{,}\) and thus it affects the derivative proportionately.</p>
