<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In the situation where we have \((x-a)\) under a square root and a polynomial outside the square root, the substitution \(u = x-a\) will allow us to convert the integrand into an expression we can integrate by changing the form of the radical from \(\sqrt{x-a}\) to \(\sqrt{u}\text{.}\) From there we are able to distribute and integrate an expression that is essentially a sum of (fractional) powers of \(u\text{.}\) In the situation where a polynomial of degree higher than \(1\) (such as \(x^2 - 1\)) is under the radical, we likely have to be fortunate enough to have the derivative of said polynomial (up to a constant) outside the radical in order to be able to integrate, as we were in the last example.</p>
