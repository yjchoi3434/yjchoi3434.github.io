<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">At the end of each section, you'll find two types of Exercises.  First, there are several anonymous WeBWorK exercises.  These are online, interactive exercises that allow you to submit answers for immediate feedback with unlimited attempts without penalty; to submit answers, you have to be using the HTML version of the text (see <a class="external" href="http://gvsu.edu/s/14i" target="_blank">this short video on the HTML version that includes a WeBWorK demonstration</a>).  You should use these exercises as a way to test your understanding of basic ideas in the preceding section.  If your institution uses WeBWorK, you may also need to log in to a server as directed by your instructor to complete assigned WeBWorK sets as part of your course grade.  The WeBWorK exercises included in this text are ungraded and not connected to any individual account.  Following the WeBWorK exercises there are 3-4 additional challenging exercises that are designed to encourage you to connect ideas, investigate new situations, and write about your understanding.  There are answers to most of the non-WeBWorK exercises <a href="exercises-answers.html" class="internal" title="Appendix C: Answers to Selected Exercises">in the back matterÂ C</a>.</p>
