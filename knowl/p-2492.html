<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The point \(A = (-\sqrt{3}, f(-\sqrt{3}))\) is a local maximum, because \(f\) is increasing prior to \(A\) and decreasing after; similarly, the point \(E = (\sqrt{3}, f(\sqrt{3})\) is a local minimum. Note, too, that \(f\) is concave down at \(A\) and concave up at \(B\text{,}\) which is consistent both with our second derivative sign chart and the second derivative test. At points \(B\) and \(D\text{,}\) concavity changes, as we saw in the results of the second derivative sign chart in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F-3-1-signchart3.html" title="Figure 3.1.12">FigureÂ 3.1.12</a>. Finally, at point \(C\text{,}\) \(f\) has a critical point with a horizontal tangent line, but neither a maximum nor a minimum occurs there, since \(f\) is decreasing both before and after \(C\text{.}\) It is also the case that concavity changes at \(C\text{.}\)</p>
