<em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="alert">SOLUTION</em> Since the graph of \(g(x)\) is a line, its average rate of change is the same over all intervals.  Since the graph of \(g(x)\) is going up, its average rate of change is always positive.  The average rate of change of \(f(x)\) is clearly changing depending on the interval.  If the slope of the line connecting the two endpoints of the interval on \(f(x)\) is going up and is steeper than the slope of \(g(x)\text{,}\) then the average rate of change of \(f(x)\) will be greater over that interval.  If the line connecting the two endpoints points on \(f(x)\) is less steep, horizontal, or going down, then the average rate of change of \(g(x)\) will greater over that interval.  If the slope of the line  connecting to endpoints of the interval on \(f(x)\) is the same as the slope of \(g(x)\text{,}\) then the two average rates of change will be equal (such as the case for the interval \(2.2 \leq x \leq 6.1\text{.}\)  Based on this consideration, you should determine the following answers: <div class="tabular-box natural-width"><table xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="tabular">
