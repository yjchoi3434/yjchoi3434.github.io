<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Note that \(v(1) = 0\) and for \(0 \lt t \lt 1\text{,}\) \(v(t) \gt 0\text{.}\) This means that on the interval \((0,1)\text{,}\) the position function \(s\) is increasing because velocity is positive.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We can check that the derivative of \(s(t) = 32t - 16t^2\) is \(s'(t) = v(t) = 32 - 32t\text{,}\) and that \(s(0) = 0\text{,}\) so this is the antiderivative of \(v\) that we desire.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Now, \(s(1) - s(\frac{1}{2}) = (32 - 16) - (16 - 4) = 4\text{,}\) which is the change in position of the ball on the interval \([\frac{1}{2},1]\text{.}\) Equivalently, since \(v\) is positive through this interval, 4 feet is the vertical distance the ball traveled during this time.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">On the interval from \(t = \frac{1}{2}\) to \(t = 1\text{,}\) the corresponding area under the velocity curve is the area of the right triangular region whose width is \(\frac{1}{2}\) seconds and whose height is \(v(\frac{1}{2}) = 16\) feet/sec. That area is therefore \(A = \frac{1}{2} bh = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot 16 = 4\) feet. This is the total distance the ball traveled vertically on \([\frac{1}{2},1]\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\(s(1) - s(0) = (32 - 16) - (0-0) = 16\text{,}\) which is the vertical distance the ball traveled on the interval \([0,1]\text{.}\) The area under the velocity curve on \([0,1]\) is the area of the triangle with height 32 (ft/sec) and base 1 (second), which is \(A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 32 = 16\) feet. These two results are identical, in part due to the fact that we are using two different perspectives to compute the same quantity, which is distance traveled.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Observe that \(s(2) - s(0) = (32 - 32) - (0 - 0) = 0\text{.}\) This means that the ball has zero change in position on the interval \([0,2]\text{.}\) But we already established that on the interval \([0,1]\text{,}\) the ball traveled 16 feet vertically; since the velocity becomes negative on the interval \(1 \lt t \lt 2\text{,}\) there we know the ball's position is decreasing, so it is falling back to earth. The resulting zero change in position means that at \(t = 2\) the ball has returned to the location from which it was tossed. If we view the area between the velocity function and the \(t\)-axis as being negative wherever \(v\) is negative, then we see that the areas of the two triangles involved are opposites, which in some sense results in the “total area” being zero, matching the change in position.</p></li>
