<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The goal of a federal government stimulus package is to positively affect the economy. Economists and politicians quote numbers like “\(k\) million jobs and a net stimulus to the economy of \(n\) billion of dollars.” Where do they get these numbers? Let's consider one aspect of a stimulus package: tax cuts. Economists understand that tax cuts or rebates can result in long-term spending that is many times the amount of the rebate. For example, assume that for a typical person, 75% of her entire income is spent (that is, put back into the economy). Further, assume the government provides a tax cut or rebate that totals \(P\) dollars for each person.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The tax cut of \(P\) dollars is income for its recipient. How much of this tax cut will be spent?</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In this simple model, we will say that the spent portion of the tax cut/rebate from part (a) then becomes income for another person who, in turn, spends 75% of this income. After this ``second round" of spent income, how many total dollars have been added to the economy as a result of the original tax cut/rebate?</p></li>
<li>
<p>This second round of spending becomes income for another group who spend 75% of this income, and so on. In economics this is called the <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">multiplier effect</em>. Explain why an original tax cut/rebate of \(P\) dollars will result in multiplied spending of</p>

<p class="continuation">dollars.</p>
</li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Based on these assumptions, how much stimulus will a 200 billion dollar tax cut/rebate to consumers add to the economy, assuming consumer spending remains consistent forever.</p></li>
