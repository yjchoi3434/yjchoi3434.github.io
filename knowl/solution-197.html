<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">\(E\) is closely related to the well known <em class="emphasis">error function</em> <a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-30-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.2.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> in probability and statistics. It turns out that the function \(e^{-t^2}\) does not have an elementary antiderivative.</p>
<p>While we cannot evaluate \(E\) exactly for any value other than \(x = 0\text{,}\) we still can gain a tremendous amount of information about the function \(E\text{.}\) By applying the rule in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/E_diffint.html" title="Equation 5.2.2">Equation (5.2.2)</a> to \(E\text{,}\) it follows that</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
E'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left[ \int_0^x e^{-t^2} \, dt \right] = e^{-x^2}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">so we know a formula for the derivative of \(E\text{,}\) and we know that \(E(0) = 0\text{.}\) This information is precisely the type we were given in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act-3-1-1.html" title="Activity 3.1.2">Activity 3.1.2</a>, where we were given information about the derivative of a function, but lacked a formula for the function itself.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Using the first and second derivatives of \(E\text{,}\) along with the fact that \(E(0) = 0\text{,}\) we can determine more information about the behavior of \(E\text{.}\) First, we note that for all real numbers \(x\text{,}\) \(e^{-x^2} \gt 0\text{,}\) and thus \(E'(x) \gt 0\) for all \(x\text{.}\) Thus \(E\) is an always increasing function. Further, as \(x \to \infty\text{,}\) \(E'(x) = e^{-x^2} \to 0\text{,}\) so the slope of the function \(E\) tends to zero as \(x \to \infty\) (and similarly as \(x \to -\infty\)). Indeed, it turns out that \(E\) has horizontal asymptotes as \(x\) increases or decreases without bound.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In addition, we can observe that \(E''(x) = -2xe^{-x^2}\text{,}\) and that \(E''(0) = 0\text{,}\) while \(E''(x) \lt 0\) for \(x \gt 0\) and \(E''(x) \gt 0\) for \(x \lt 0\text{.}\) This information tells us that \(E\) is concave up for \(x\lt 0\) and concave down for \(x \gt 0\) with a point of inflection at \(x = 0\text{.}\)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The only thing we lack at this point is a sense of how big \(E\) can get as \(x\) increases. If we use a midpoint Riemann sum with 10 subintervals to estimate \(E(2)\text{,}\) we see that \(E(2) \approx 0.8822\text{;}\) a similar calculation to estimate \(E(3)\) shows little change (\(E(3) \approx 0.8862\)), so it appears that as \(x\) increases without bound, \(E\) approaches a value just larger than \(0.886\text{,}\) which aligns with the fact that \(E\) has horizontal asymptotes. Putting all of this information together (and using the symmetry of \(f(t) = e^{-t^2}\)), we see the results shown in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F-5-2-erf.html" title="Figure 5.2.4">Figure 5.2.4</a>.</p>
