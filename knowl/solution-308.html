<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We recalling that a function \(f\) has a limit \(L\) at infinity if we can make the values of \(f(x)\) as large as we want by choosing \(x\) as large as we need. Since we can make the values of \(n\) in our sequence as large as we want by choosing \(n\) to be as large as we need, we suspect that this sequence does not have a limit as \(n\) goes to infinity.</p>
