<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In (a) we are determining the instantaneous rate at which the volume changes as we increase the height of the water in the tank, while in (c) we are finding the instantaneous rate at which volume changes as we increase time. The first calculation is a direct one, while the second is more indirect, as it involves the composition of \(V\) with \(h\) as a function of time. In the latter case, both \(h\) and \(V\) are functions of time, which allows us to think not only of how \(V\) is changing as a function of \(h\text{,}\) but also as a function of \(t\text{.}\)</p>
