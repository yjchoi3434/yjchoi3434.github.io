<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The preceding example demonstrates the standard approach to finding the work required to empty a tank filled with liquid. The main task in each such problem is to determine the volume of a representative slice, followed by the force exerted on the slice, as well as the distance such a slice moves. In the case where the units are metric, there is one key difference: in the metric setting, rather than weight, we normally first find the mass of a slice. For instance, if distance is measured in meters, the mass density of water is 1000 kg/m\(^3\text{.}\) In that setting, we can find the mass of a typical slice (in kg). To determine the force required to move it, we use \(F = ma\text{,}\) where \(m\) is the object's mass and \(a\) is the gravitational constant \(a=9.81\) N/kg. That is, in metric units, the weight density of water is 9810 N/m\(^3\text{.}\)</p>
