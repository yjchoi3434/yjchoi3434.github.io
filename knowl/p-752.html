<ul class="disc">
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">A differentiable function \(f\) is increasing on an interval whenever its first derivative is positive, and decreasing whenever its first derivative is negative.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">By taking the derivative of the derivative of a function \(f\text{,}\) we arrive at the second derivative, \(f''\text{.}\) The second derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of the first derivative. The sign of the second derivative tells us whether the slope of the tangent line to \(f\) is increasing or decreasing.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">A differentiable function is concave up whenever its first derivative is increasing (or equivalently whenever its second derivative is positive), and concave down whenever its first derivative is decreasing (or equivalently whenever its second derivative is negative). Examples of functions that are everywhere concave up are \(y = x^2\) and \(y = e^x\text{;}\) examples of functions that are everywhere concave down are \(y = -x^2\) and \(y = -e^x\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The units on the second derivative are “units of output per unit of input per unit of input.” They tell us how the value of the derivative function is changing in response to changes in the input. In other words, the second derivative tells us the rate of change of the rate of change of the original function.</p></li>
