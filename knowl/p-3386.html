<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Filters at a water treatment plant become dirtier over time and thus become less effective; they are replaced every 30 days. During one 30-day period, the rate at which pollution passes through the filters into a nearby lake (in units of particulate matter per day) is measured every 6 days and is given in the following table. The time \(t\) is measured in days since the filters were replaced.</p>
