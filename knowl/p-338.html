<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F-1-3-SecToTanSeq.html" title="Figure 1.3.5">FigureÂ 1.3.5</a> shows a sequence of figures with several different lines through the points \((a, f(a))\) and \((a+h,f(a+h))\text{,}\) generated by different values of \(h\text{.}\) These lines (shown in the first three figures in magenta), are often called <em class="emphasis">secant lines</em>  to the curve \(y = f(x)\text{.}\) A secant line to a curve is simply a line that passes through two points on the curve. For each such line, the slope of the secant line is \(m = \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}\text{,}\) where the value of \(h\) depends on the location of the point we choose. We can see in the diagram how, as \(h \to 0\text{,}\) the secant lines start to approach a single line that passes through the point \((a,f(a))\text{.}\) If the limit of the slopes of the secant lines exists, we say that the resulting value is the slope of the <em class="emphasis">tangent line</em> to the curve. This tangent line  (shown in the right-most figure in green) to the graph of \(y = f(x)\) at the point \((a,f(a))\) has slope \(m = f'(a)\text{.}\)</p>
